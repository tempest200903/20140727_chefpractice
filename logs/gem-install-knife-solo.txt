Depending on your version of ruby, you may need to install ruby rdoc/ri data:

<= 1.8.6 : unsupported
 = 1.8.7 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
 = 1.9.1 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
>= 1.9.2 : nothing to do! Yay!
Thanks for installing knife-solo!

If you run into any issues please let us know at:

If you are upgrading knife-solo please uninstall any old versions by
running `gem clean knife-solo` to avoid any errors.

See http://bit.ly/CHEF-3255 for more information on the knife bug
that causes this.
